Input: The input to the function find_min_completion_time is a list of tuples jobs, where each tuple represents a job. The first element of the tuple is the duration of the job, and the second element is its deadline.

Initialization: Initialize two lists completion_times and start_times of length equal to the number of jobs, initially filled with zeros. These lists will keep track of the completion times and whether a time slot has been assigned to a job, respectively.

Sorting: Sort the jobs list based on the job deadlines in ascending order. This ensures that we consider jobs with earlier deadlines first.

Iterating over jobs: Iterate over each job in the sorted list.

Finding available time slot: For each job, find the latest available time slot before its deadline. This is done by iterating from the minimum of the job's deadline and the total number of jobs minus one down to zero.

Assigning job to time slot: When an available time slot is found (where start_times[i] == 0), mark that time slot as assigned (start_times[i] = 1) and calculate the completion time for the job by adding its duration to the time slot index (i + duration). Set this completion time in the completion_times list.

Returning minimum completion time: After assigning time slots to all jobs, find the maximum completion time from the completion_times list. This represents the minimum completion time required to complete all jobs without missing any deadlines.

Output: Return the maximum completion time as the result.
